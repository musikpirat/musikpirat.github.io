<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>
Right now this site only features the first public preview of ccMixter2Go - an app intented to make listening to <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccmixter</a> even more joyful.
</p>
Please consider it as highly experimental! (After many month of not touching the app I recently started porting it to be a <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Web_App">PWA</a>.
The code was ugly before and has not become any cleaner...)
</p>
<p>
The app has been tested with Chrome on Linux, and Chrome and Firefox on Android. While PWAs work generally on iOS they are heavily limitated (you can store only 50 MB offline - not much space for songs...).

So are you ready to go? Then click (or tap) the icon below.
